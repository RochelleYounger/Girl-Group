# Motiv8

## Description
We wanted to create an app that helps motivate users to reach their goal. Users could form groups of up to 8 to share a common “Journey” and progress together as they complete goals. This Website uses Reactjs on the Frontend, Nodejs on the backend and for its Database it uses MongoDB Atlas which is a cloud Database provider.
